Week 8, Section U02

Write a program that computes the average of a list of numbers entered by the 
user. The numbers are supposed to be in the range 50 â€“ 100 (inclusive) and the 
user will indicate that he/she is done with data input by entering a value not 
in that range. At least one number will be in the range. Use a WHILE or a 
DO-WHILE loop.
